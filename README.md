# PREP Visual Studio Code Extension

**Programming Replication Experiments Protocol (PREP)** is a *draft* protocol for designing interventions that occur during programming practice, which can be run across different practice environments. 

The PREP Visual Studio Code Extension turns VS Code into a programming practice environment that implements PREP, and also includes support for autograding students work on an autograding server.

## Setup

To install PREP:
1. If you have not already, install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. If you have not already, install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
3. Open a terminal and run `npm install` in this directory.
4. Run (F5) the extension. VS Code should automatically compile the code and open a new window with the extension installed.
